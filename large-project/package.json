/* We set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION to true by default to install production dependencies only. 
If you would like to install devDependencies, you can disable production mode:
$ heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
However, since you usually don’t want all development dependencies in your production builds, 
it’s preferable to move only the dependencies you actually need for production builds (bower, grunt, gulp, etc) into dependencies.*/
